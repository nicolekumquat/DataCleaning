This project consists of

2. a script which performs analysis on the data to provide the mean of several measurements for each test subject & each activity performed by the subject (run_analysis.R)
3. a file which explains the generated data (CodeBook.md)
4. the resultant data in a clean format (Mean_By_Activity_and_Subject.csv)
